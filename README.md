# rap-quotes

This is a hard-coded mock up for the _Same App, Different Framework_ project.
SADF aims to recreate the same app using different frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, etc, etc) in order to compare and learn each framework.

`rap-quotes` is the skeleton for that common app in the project.
It was created here by hand just to work through all the desired CSS and HTML _before_ attempting to recreate the concept in other frameworks.

The app simply displays a select few of dope rap bars from various rappers.
Nothing too fancy, but robust enough to serve as more than a simple Hello, World app.

## Features
In order to serve as a good app, this app aims to use the following features that are commonly seen during web app development.

- [x] **CRUD**: the big four verbs can be applied to each quote in each framework 
- [x] **https calls**: 
- [x] **form validation**: creating a quote requires a form
- [x] **modal**: the create form is displayed in a modal
- [ ] **toast**: on success/fail of CRUD ops
- [ ] **sortable/filterable table**: perhaps a table view of all the quotes?
- [ ] **grid/table view switcher**
- [ ] **routing/nav**: main page, table view, about page
- [ ] **testing**
- [ ] **search**: query all the quotes
- [ ] **date picker**: 
- [ ] **localization**: this may actually be difficult with slang in quotes ðŸ¤”
